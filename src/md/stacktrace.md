Stacktrace is an end-to-end technology consultancy company. In my time at Stacktrace I have worked as as full stack senior software engineer on different projects, each with different stacks:

<u>Emerging Healthcare</u>
Working on a telehealth solution on the cloud. This solution was used by GPs to undertake their consults through video as well as paediatrics to supply urgent care after hours.
