I am an extremely passionate full stack engineer favoring .NET (C# / F#) on the backend and React/Angular on the front end whilst having a broad experience in many other technologies.
I am in love with using functional programming patterns to create intelligent, fast, secure, maintainable, readable, testable and reliable systems.
I am a strong believer in being in a continuous state of learning as technology continues to rapidly evolve.
I also believe that working in a team of people with the same passion is paramount.
